Subject: Reminder: History Department Research Symposium â€“ 10th May

Dear Dr. Patel,
This is a friendly reminder about the upcoming History Department Research Symposium scheduled for 10th May in the Humanities Building, Lecture Theatre 3. The event will run from 9:30 am until 4 pm.
Several graduate students and faculty members will be presenting their latest research findings, including topics on 19th-century colonialism and early modern European political history. We hope this will be an inspiring day of scholarly exchange.
Please feel free to encourage your colleagues and students to attend. Lunch and refreshments will be provided.

Kind regards,
Sophie Turner
