Subject: Upcoming Lecture on Medieval Trade Routes – 30th April

Dear Dr. Smith,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you about an upcoming lecture titled "Medieval Trade Routes and their Economic Impact," which will be held on 30th April in the University Hall, Room 204, starting at 3 pm.
The lecture is part of the History Department’s Spring Seminar Series and will be presented by Professor Eleanor Hughes from the Economics Faculty. It might be a great opportunity for your students interested in the economic history aspects of the medieval period.
Please let me know if you would like me to reserve a block of seats for your department or if you would like to circulate this information further.

Best regards,
Michael Lee
